# What is changed / added

- Using new build system and migrated to .Net Core as much as I can
- Add support to call GetVoiceSettings and subscribe VoiceUpdate so I can use this to monitor mute status
- Some code clean up, not nessesarily on a good direction
- Buggy and crappy code to get above done
